# Convert mesh files from bdf to xdmf

This is the workflow to convert mesh files generated by commercial software (**bdf** is a commonly used format) to **xdmf** format as the input for the problems using FEniCSx.
The steps for preprocessing [uCRM wingbox mesh](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gpk4zn73xn/1) from online resource are as following:

1) modify the input file name in `read_bdf.py` to the file you want to operate on and run the script
2) open `mesh_quad_template.xdmf`:
    - after `<DataItem DataType="Float" Dimensions="xxx 3" Format="XML" Precision="8">` copy the coordinates of the nodes from `xyz.txt`
    - then after `<Topology NodesPerElement="4" NumberOfElements="xx" TopologyType="quadrilateral">
 <DataItem DataType="Int" Dimensions="xx 4" Format="XML" Precision="4">` copy paste the connectivity matrix from `elements.txt`, which positions the element node IDs counterclockwise.
    - and change the "Dimensions/NumberOfElements" correspondingly.
3) you can then call this mesh from your code as the input.
